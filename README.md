An (experimental) Julia package for computing the *Structured Singular Value (SSV, also Œº)* of a (in general) complex matrix. In fact, just *lower and upper bounds* are computed as the computation of the exact value is known to be NP hard.

## What is *Structured Singular Value* of a matrix?
In order to explain what *structured singular value* is, we need to recall what classical [singular value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value) of a matrix is. In particular, we focus on the largest singular value ÃÑœÉ(M), which plays the role of an operator norm for the matrix M.

Furthermore, we need to be able to specify a *structure* of a matrix. Loosely speaking, we just specify which elements in the matrix are zero and which a free to assume real or complex values. For some matrix Œî, we say that if it has the given structure, it belong to some set ùö´, that is, Œî‚ààùö´.

With the concept of a singular value and some way to characterize a structure of a matrix, we can define the (largest) structured singular value of a matrix M in the following way

```math
\mu_\Delta(M) = \frac{1}{\min \{\bar{\sigma}(\Delta): Œî\in\boldsymbol\Delta, \mathrm{det}(I-M\Delta)=0\}}
```

There is a useful alternative "definition" of the largest singular value of a matrix M. We assume that there is another matrix Œî whose largest singular value is, say, Œ≥. The largest singular value



## Usage of the `StructuredSingularValues.jl` package

## Anticipated use in analysis of robust stability of LTI systems
An anticipated use of this computation is in analysis of robustness of linear time invariant (LTI) dynamical systems. If such a system is modelled by a (matrix) transfer function M(s), structured singular value(s) are computed for a grid of frequencies œâ‚Çñ, k=1,‚Ä¶,N, at which the transfer function M(s) evaluates to M(jœâ‚Çñ). This evaluation of the matrix M(s) at a grid of points along the imaginary axis and subsequent computation of the SSV is left for the user. In this package we only aim at computing the SSV for a given (constant) matrix.
